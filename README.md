_“The computer is not an end in itself, but a tool to serve people.” – Heinz Nixdorf_

A tribute to Heinz Nixdorf on the occasion of his **100th birth anniversary** — this interactive AI chatbot lets you have a meaningful conversation with the legendary German computing pioneer, entrepreneur, and visionary technologist from Paderborn.

Built with ❤️ by [Nikhil Jha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhanikhil19) using the **Gemini API** and **Streamlit**, this project blends history with technology to bring Heinz Nixdorf’s mind and values to the modern world.
